# Distributed-Project
## introduction
The project is an online text editor that enables you to connect to the same editor and accepts many users by requiring a password. The text editor has a number of features, such as the ability to change the style, bold, italicise, underline, create ordered and unordered lists, and reverse the styling.
## describtion
We used socket programming, peer-to-peer, Heroku, and AWS to make the text editor functional. The file ID and the password produced when the file creator clicked "Share" are entered by the client while connecting to the server. They will be able to see the file id and password, and we can share with others to join and edit this particular file collectively.
## Beneficiaries
